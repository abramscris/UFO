## Overview of Project

This analysis will help the journalist Dana to have a better look into UFO information in the data provided, refining and displaying UFO data. Since Dana hometown McMinnville OR is famous for UFO seekers this project will dive on filters and tables to help provide a clear way to access this information through JavaScript displayed on a HTML page.

## Results
On this webpage developed for the data of UFO reported provided, Dana can investigate specific states, such as her home state and when typed the abbreviation of the state selected, Dana and anyone who access this page will see details about reports, such as duration, the shape of object not identified, the city that took place and the comments. Any of the blank spaces can be filled with the information needed and once you press Enter you will have the results on the right side of the page.
On image we can see the webpage refined by the state where Dana grown up in it:

## Summary

### Drawback

Unfortunately, the data provided is specific for the kind of information displayed, what makes harder to filter if the user do not know specific dates, also the spelling needs to be in lower cases and exactly like spelled on the data file, otherwise is not recognized by the page.

### Recommendations

For a better view of this HTML page the user should be able to select range of dates such as per year or month. That would probably give a better look in the big picture and help setup metrics.

Another change that would make the page more intuitive and user friendly would be a trim function that allow the user to look into words typing just a few letters, either upper or lower case and getting the selected data.
